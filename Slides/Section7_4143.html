<h1>Properties of Continuous Distributions</h1>
<ol class="incremental" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The vertical axis does not represent probability</li>
<li>Probabilities are represented by areas under the curve</li>
<li>The total area under the curve is 1.</li>
<li>Can't talk about the probabilitly of a single score - always have to talk about ranges</li>

<h1>Properties of The Normal Distribution</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Symmetric about the center of the distribution.</li>
<li>Mean, median, and mode are all equal.</li>
<li>Range: <span class="math">\(-\infty \leq X \leq \infty\)</span></li>
<li>The tails are asymptotic to the x-axis.
<ul class="incremental">
<li>i.e. The tails get very close to the x-axis, but never touch it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The distribution has 0 skewness and kurtosis.<br /></li>
<li>Very few scores greater than <span class="math">\(\mu + 3\sigma\)</span></li>
<li>The total area under any probability distribution regardless of the shape is 1.<br /></li>
<li>We will use this fact in tandem with the mean and variation of a distribution to assign a probability of a specific value or mean.</li>

<li><span class="math">\(X\)</span> is the raw score</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is the population mean</li>
