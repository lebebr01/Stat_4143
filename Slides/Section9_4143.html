<li>The <strong>p-value</strong> is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed, given that the null hypothesis is true.</li>

<p>The average individual works out an average of 3.75 hours per week (45 minutes, 5 days a week), with a standard deviation of 1 hour. Suppose we collect a sample of 159 participants and the sample mean was 4.87 hours of exercise per week. Is our sample mean significantly greater than the national population at <span class="math">\(\alpha = .05\)</span>?</p>
