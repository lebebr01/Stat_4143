\section{Properties of Continuous
Distributions}\label{properties-of-continuous-distributions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The vertical axis does not represent probability
\item
  Probabilities are represented by areas under the curve
\item
  The total area under the curve is 1.
\item
  Can't talk about the probabilitly of a single score - always have to
  talk about ranges
\item
  Countinuous distributions that have means and standard deviations
  require calculus to computer
\end{enumerate}

Mathematical}\label{the-normal-distribution---mathematical}

\section{Properties of The Normal
Distribution}\label{properties-of-the-normal-distribution}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Symmetric about the center of the distribution.
\item
  Mean, median, and mode are all equal.
\item
  Range: \(-\infty \leq X \leq \infty\)
\item
  The tails are asymptotic to the x-axis.

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    i.e.~The tails get very close to the x-axis, but never touch it.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The distribution has 0 skewness and kurtosis.\\
\item
  Very few scores greater than \(\mu + 3\sigma\)
\item
  The total area under any probability distribution regardless of the
  shape is 1.\\
\item
  We will use this fact in tandem with the mean and variation of a
  distribution to assign a probability of a specific value or mean.

standard deviation of 1.8 years.

\item
  What percentage of employees stay on the job more than 6.2 years?

  What percentage of employees stay on the job less than 0.8 years?

  9.8 years?

\section{Standard Scores}\label{standard-scores}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A \emph{z-score}, also called a standard score, is a way to represent
  a score in standard deviation units.
\item
  To compute a z-score: \[ z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \]
\item
  \(X\) is the raw score
\item
  \(\mu\) is the population mean
\item
  \(\sigma\) is the population standard deviation
\item
  A distribution of z-scores is also called the standard normal
  distribution.
\end{itemize}

  \item
    \(X = 4.8\)

  z-score(s).

of 1.1 pounds.

Use the empirical rule to answer:\\1. What proportion of infants weigh
more than 8.1 pounds?\\2. What proportion of infants weigh less than 4.8
pounds?\\3. What proportion of infants are between 5.9 and 8.1 pounds?

Use the z-table to answer the following:\\1. What proportion of infants
weigh less than 5 pounds?\\2. What percentage of infants weigh more than
7.2 pounds?\\3. What proportion of infants weigh between 4.9 pounds and
7.1 pounds?\\4. How much would an infant weigh if they were in the top
12\%?\\5. How much would an infant weigh if they were in the bottom 4\%?
