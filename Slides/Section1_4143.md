# Introduction to Statistics
- What is statistics?
    - Statistics is the science of gaining information from numerical data
- The root of statistics comes from numerical data
    - Produce data
    - Organize data
    - Draw conclusions from data
    
# Descriptive Statistics
- Descriptive statistics aim to summarize or explore the data
    - Tell a story of data analysis
- These statistics can take the form of graphics, tables, or single numerical summaries
- Examples of this include:
    - Make summary statements about the data, on average...
    - Explore the distribution of the data, where do the bulk of the data fall?
    - Explore similarities or differences between groups
    
# Inferential Statistics
- Inferential statistics aim to quantify uncertainty in the data and use probability to understand how likely a hypothesis is. 
- Many inferential techniques aim to answer questions that explore the relationship between two or more variables. 
- Inferential statistics are useful because it is common in an experiment to not have data on everything. 
    - Example: Imagine testing for the presence of bacteria at a beach.
    - Example: Imagine exploring the relationship between amount of sleep the night before a test and the performance on a test.
    
# Data Uncertainty
- Data vary
- As a result, conclusions on uncertain data are also uncertain.
- Statistics is a tool to help us quantify the uncertainty and use that to make meaningful conclusions.
- Statistics helps us determine if a result is spurious (uncertain) or meaningful.

# Questions for Statistics
- The following are useful questions to always have in mind when considering a statistical technique:
    - What assumptions underlie the technique?
    - When and where is the technique valid?
    - What are the advantages and disadvantages of the technique relative to others?
    - What interpretations can be made based on the technique?
    - What are the common problems associated with the technique?
    
# Variables vs Constants
- Variables:
    - vary
    - are commonly represented by symbols, x, y, z
    - need to be measured. Measurement of a variable is the process of assigning numbers  or labels to characteristics of people, objects, or events according to a set of rules.
- Constants:
    - do not vary
    - are commonly represented by symbols, a, b, c
    
# Types of variables
- Qualitative variables:
    - represent categories
    - are not numbers
    - but can be represented with numeric symbols
    - can be ordered or unordered
- Quantitative variables:
    - reflect numeric quantities
    - can be discrete or continuous
    
# Levels of Measurement
- Nominal Measurement:
    - represent mutually exclusive categories
    - are commonly represented with labels
    - can be represented with numeric labels
    - is not meaningful to manipulate mathematically
    - carries no meaningful order
- Ordinal Measurement:
    - carries all information from nominal measurement
    - represent mutually exclusive categories that are ordered
- Interval Measurement:
   - carries all information from nominal and ordinal measurement
   - represent equal distance between equivalent gaps
   - 0 is not meaningful
   - can now perform linear transformations meaningfully
- Ratio Measurement:
   - carries all information from nominal, ordinal, and interval measurement
   - but now 0 measn the absence of the phenomenon
   - can only be transformed by multiplying
   
# Measurement in the Social Sciences
- When measuring variables with an instrument or questionnaire, there is commonly a lack of equal intervals or an absolute zero.
- Examples: creativity, problem solving, attitude toward statistics, achievement
    - The distances between adjacent scores based on an instrument are likely not equal.
    - For an achievement test, if an individual can not answer any questions, that does not mean they have a total absence of ability/achievement.
    
# Measurement of Ordered Variables
- The purpose of measurement is to differentiate among individuals or objects on a variable.
- To do this, rules must be established to assign values to a specific variable.
- When the rules for a measurement process are not widely accepted, we must adopt a two-step measurement process.

# Two Step Measurement Process
1. Develop a *conceptual* definition.
    - This is abstract or a theoretical definition
2. Develop an *operational* definition
   - More concrete
   - Based on the conceptual definition
   - Commonly defines rules to allow for the measurement of the phenomenon.
   
# Two Step Measurement Process Example
- Consider the variable motivation
- Conceptual Definition
    - The general desire or willingness of someone to do something
- Operational Definition
    - Give a list of 50 statements of tasks.
    - Then ask each individual to indicate the extent they enjoy doing each task - from strongly do not enjoy to strongly enjoy.
    
# Reliability
- A measurement process is reliable if *repeated measurements* on the *same individual* give the same (or similar) results.
- Examples: 
    - If a second set of 50 similar tasks were given to the same individuals, would individuals order the tasks similarly?
    - If the same set of 50 tasks were given to the same individuals, would the students be order the tasks similarly?
    
# Validity
- A variable is a valid measure of a property if it is relevant or appropriate as a representation of that property.
- Is the ordering of individuals based on a particular operational definition the same as (or similar to) the ordering based on a different operational definition?
- A common question to test validity is to ask ourselves whether the measure reflects the construct of interest.
    - More simply, are we measuring what we want or something else?
    
# Real Limits
- The real limits of a score extend from one-half of the smallest unit of measurement below the value of the score to one-half unit above
- Examples:
    - Consider a distance of 85 inches, measured to the nearest inch (the smallest unit of measurement is one inch).
        - The real limits of 85 extend from 84.5 to 85.5.
        - As such, a score of 85 inches actually represents all values between 84.5 and 85.5.
    - Suppose we measure length to the nearest tenth of an inch
        - A measurement of 2.3 inches - what are the real limits?
        - 2.25 to 2.35 inches.
- Unfortunately there are exceptions.
    - Age is one example
- No score can ever fall right on a real limit, because we calculate real limits by taking half of the smallest unit of measurement.

# Real Limits 2
- Example:
    - Consider grade point averages in the interval from 2.60 to 2.79.
        - The smallest unit of measurement is one-hundredth.
        - The lower and upper real limits of the interval are 2.595 and 2.795 respectively.
        
# Population vs Sample
- Population: 
    - The complete set of observations about which a researcher wishes to draw a conclusion.
    - A descriptive index of a population is referred to as a *parameter*.
    - Population Parameter
- Sample:
    - Part of the population about which a researcher wishes to draw a conclusion.
    - A descriptive index of a sample is referred to as a *statistic*.
    - Sample Statistic
    
# Random Sample
- A random sample is a sample obtained such that each individual has an equal chance of being selected at any stage of the sampling process.
- Also, each possible sample of the same size has an equal probability of being selected from the population.
- A population is defined by the interest of the investigator.

# Inferential Statistics
- With inferential statistics, we are interested in estimating population parameters from sample statistics.
- An essential assumption in inferential statistics is that samples are drawn randomly from a particular population.
- If several random samples of the same size are drawn from the same population, the samples will most likely differ, and therefore their characteristics (statistics) will vary from sample to sample.
- The variation is due to chance variation associataed with random sampling.
    - This is commonly called sampling error.
- The larger the random sample from the population, the less the variation between samples.
- In general larger random samples will provide a more precise estimate of what is true about a population.
