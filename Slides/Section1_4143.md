# Introduction to Statistics
- What is statistics?
    - Statistics is the science of gaining information from numerical data
- The root of statistics comes from numerical data
    - Produce data
    - Organize data
    - Draw conclusions from data
    
# Descriptive Statistics
- Descriptive statistics aim to summarize or explore the data
    - Tell a story of data analysis
- These statistics can take the form of graphics, tables, or single numerical summaries
- Examples of this include:
    - Make summary statements about the data, on average...
    - Explore the distribution of the data, where do the bulk of the data fall?
    - Explore similarities or differences between groups
    
# Descriptive Statistics Examples


# Inferential Statistics
- Inferential statistics aim to quantify uncertainty in the data and use probability to understand how likely a hypothesis is. 
- Many inferential techniques aim to answer questions that explore the relationship between two or more variables. 
- Inferential statistics are useful because it is common in an experiment to not have data on everything. 
    - Example: Imagine testing for the presence of bacteria at a beach.
    - Example: Imagine exploring the relationship between amount of sleep the night before a test and the performance on a test.
    
# Data Uncertainty
- Data vary
- As a result, conclusions on uncertain data are also uncertain.
- Statistics is a tool to help us quantify the uncertainty and use that to make meaningful conclusions.
- Statistics helps us determine if a result is spurious (uncertain) or meaningful.

# Scaffolding for Research
- Think back to the scientific method from science classes in high school.

# Questions for Statistics
- The following are useful questions to always have in mind when considering a statistical technique:
    - What assumptions underlie the technique?
    - When and where is the technique valid?
    - What are the advantages and disadvantages of the technique relative to others?
    - What interpretations can be made based on the technique?
    - What are the common problems associated with the technique?
    
# Variables vs Constants
- Variables:
    - vary
    - are commonly represented by symbols, x, y, z
- Constants:
    - do not vary
    - are commonly represented by symbols, a, b, c
    
# Types of variables
- Qualitative variables:
    - represent categories
    - are not numbers
    - but can be represented with numeric symbols
    - can be ordered or unordered
- Quantitative variables:
    - reflect numeric quantities
    - can be discrete or continuous
    
# Levels of Measurement
- Nominal Measurement:
    - represent mutually exclusive categories
    - are commonly represented with labels
    - can be represented with numeric labels
    - is not meaningful to manipulate mathematically
    - carries no meaningful order
- Ordinal Measurement:
    - carries all information from nominal measurement
    - represent mutually exclusive categories that are ordered
- Interval Measurement:
   - carries all information from nominal and ordinal measurement
   - represent equal distance between equivalent gaps
   - 0 is not meaningful
   - can now perform linear transformations meaningfully
- Ratio Measurement:
   - carries all information from nominal, ordinal, and interval measurement
   - but now 0 measn the absence of the phenomenon
   - can only be transformed by multiplying
