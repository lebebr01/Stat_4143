# Summarizing Data
- Data in its raw form is often too complex to summarize and understand quickly.
- As such, summarizing the data with descriptive statistics (section 3) or with tables and graphs (this section) can be very helpful.

# Motivating Example
```{r summarize}
# Function to wrap printing.
wrap_print <- function(table, num_row = NULL, num_col = 2) {
  if(is.null(num_row)) {
    num_row <- nrow(table)/2
  }
  ngroups <- nrow(table)/num_row
  
  tmp <- lapply(1:ngroups, function(xx) 
    table[((xx-1)*num_row+1):((xx-1)*num_row + num_row), ])
  tmp <- do.call("cbind", tmp)
  return(tmp)
}

# Ungrouped Frequency Table Creation Steps
- To create an ungrouped frequency table:
    1. List all numbers from the minimum to maximum
    2. Count the number that fall within each number
    3. Numbers can have 0 frequency
    
- Strengths:
    - Able to see all the numbers in the distribution
    - Can quickly glance at the range
    - Can quickly see which number is most frequent.
- Weaknesses:
    - Tables can be large depending on range
    - Lose some information, namely who had which value

# Grouped Frequency Table Creation Steps
- To create a grouped frequency table:
    1. First need to find the class interval size
       $$ i = Real Upper Limit - Real Lower Limit $$
    2. List out all the class intervals
    3. Count the number that fall within each interval
    
- Strengths:
    - Can quickly see where most values fall
    - 
- Weaknesses:
    - No longer know exact values
    - The choice of class interval size can influence the table
    
# Effect of Class Interval Size
```{r freqclass}
freq_tab2 <- movies %>%
  filter(year == 2004) %>%
  select(title, length)

breaks <- seq(0, 200, by = 5)
data.frame(table(cut(freq_tab2$length, breaks, right = FALSE)))

breaks <- seq(0, 200, by = 10)
data.frame(table(cut(freq_tab2$length, breaks, right = FALSE)))

breaks <- seq(0, 200, by = 20)
data.frame(table(cut(freq_tab2$length, breaks, right = FALSE)))

breaks <- seq(0, 200, by = 50)
data.frame(table(cut(freq_tab2$length, breaks, right = FALSE)))
```

# Additional Notes for Grouped Frequency Tables
- The class intervals should be mutually exclusive
- For quantitative values, no gaps between class intervals
- All class intervals should be the same size
- On average, 10 to 20 class intervals are most appropriate
- Common class interval sizes include: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...
- The lower limit should equal the class size times a constant integer (i.e. 5 * 10 = 50)

# Unequal Frequency Distributions
- One area where unequal frequency distributions can be useful is with variables such as income.
- Income tends to have more individuals at the low end and fewer at the high end.
- As such, it can be helpful to have larger class intervals at the upper end of the income scale.
- Unequal intervals can be used for tables, but not for graphs.

# Unequal Frequency Distribution Example
![Unequal Income](Unequal_Income.png)

# Relative Frequency Distributions
- These are frequency distributions with proportion or percentage of each class interval
- Useful for comparisons of two or more groups especially when the number in each group differ

# Relative Frequency by Groups
```{r freqgroups}
tmp_movies <- movies %>%
  filter(year == 2004 & mpaa %in% c('PG', 'R')) %>%
  select(length, mpaa)
breaks <- seq(10, 180, by = 15)
tmp <- split(tmp_movies, tmp_movies$mpaa)
tmp <- lapply(1:length(tmp), function(xx)
  cut(tmp[[xx]]$length, breaks, right = FALSE))
tmp2 <- data.frame(length = c(tmp[[3]], tmp[[5]]), 
                   mpaa = rep(c('PG', 'R'), 
                              times = c(length(tmp[[3]]),
                                        length(tmp[[5]]))))
tmp_tab <- table(tmp2$length, tmp2$mpaa)
```

# Cumulative Frequency Creation
1. Start with a basic frequency distribution, grouped or ungrouped.
2. Starting with the smallest value, keep a running tally of the number encountered.
    - This can be done by taking the frequency for the current category plus all prior categories
3. Optional - add columns for cumulative proportion or cumulative percentage.

# Frequency Distribution for Qualitative Variables
```{r qual}
table(movies$mpaa)
```

# Graphs
- Graphs are a great alternative to many of the tables we discussed above as they tend to be easier to quickly interpret and understand.
- One benefit of graphs is the ability to explore the shape of distributions.
- However, it is also easier to create misleading graphics.
- Graphs for quantiative variables:
    - Histograms
    - Frequency Polygons
    - Cumulative Polygon (Ogive)
    - Stem and Leaf
- Graphs for qualitative variables:
    - Bar Graphs
    - Pie Charts
- Note: there are many other graphs that can be used too that we are not discussing.

# Histograms
- A histogram is a visual representation of a frequency table for quantitative variables.
- No gaps between bars as the x-axis is continuous.

```{r hist}
h <- ggplot(freq_tab, aes(x = length)) + theme_bw(base_size = 16)
h + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "grey30") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(70, 180, 10))
```

# Shapes of Distributions
- Distributions can be categorized based on their symmetry (skewness) and kurtosis.
- Symmetry/Skewness is the amount a distribution leans one way or the other.
    - A symmetric distribution is one where each half of the distribution are mirror images of one another.
    - An asymmetric (skewed) distribution is one where they are not mirror images.
    - A positively (right) skewed distribution is one where the bulk of data lie in the lower portion with a long upper tail.
    - A negatively (left) skewed distribution is one where the bulk of data lie in the upper portion with a long lower tail.
- Kurtosis refers to the peakedness of the distribution. Relatedly, this also refers to the portion of the distribution that resides in the tails.
    - Mesokurtic refers to an intermediate distribution with average tails and peakedness.
    - Platykurtic refers to a distribution that is flatter with more observations in the tail.
    - Leptokurtic refers to a distribution that is steeper with fewer observations in the tail.
    
# Describing Distributions
- Location (Central Tendency)
    - Where is the middle score?
    - Where are the scores concentrated?
- Variability
    - Dispersion
    - Spread
    - Range
    
# Examples of common shapes

# Shapes with Histograms
![Skew Shape](skew_dist.png)
![Kurt Shape](kurt_dist.png)

# Factors Affecting Distribution Shape
1. Sampling
    - The larger the sample size, the closer it will approximate the population.
2. Relative Scale
    - The height of the histogram should be 3/4 of the width.
3. Frequency Scale
    - Always continuous and start at 0.
4. Interval size / number of intervals

# Effect of Sampling
```{r histsamp}
h <- ggplot(sample_n(freq_tab2, 500), aes(x = length)) + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
h + geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "grey30") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 240, 15))

h <- ggplot(sample_n(freq_tab2, 100), aes(x = length)) + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
h + geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "grey30") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 240, 15))

h <- ggplot(sample_n(freq_tab2, 10), aes(x = length)) + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
h + geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "grey30") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 240, 15))
```

# Effect of Binwidth on Histograms
```{r histbin}
h <- ggplot(freq_tab, aes(x = length)) + theme_bw(base_size = 16)
h + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "grey30") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(70, 180, 5))

h + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "grey30") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(70, 180, 10))

h + geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, color = "grey30") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(70, 180, 20))

h + geom_histogram(binwidth = 40, color = "grey30") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(70, 180, 40))
```


# Cumulative Polygon (Ogive)
- The cumulative polygon or ogive, is a graphical representation of the cumulative frequency.
- This plot is unique in that it never decreases.

```{r ogive}
breaks <- seq(70, 180, 10)
length_cut <- cut(freq_tab$length, breaks, right = FALSE)
length_tab <- table(length_cut)
cumfreq <- c(0, cumsum(length_tab))
length_df <- data.frame(freq = c(0, length_tab), cf = cumfreq, brks = seq(70, 180, 10))
cf <- ggplot(length_df, aes(x = brks, y = cf)) + theme_bw(base_size = 16)
cf + geom_point() + geom_line() + 
  scale_x_continuous("Length", breaks = breaks) + 
  ylab("Cumulative Freq")
```

# Ogive - Cumulative Percentage
```{r ogivepercent}
cf <- ggplot(length_df, aes(x = brks, y = I(cf/max(cf)*100))) + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
cf + geom_point() + geom_line() + 
  scale_x_continuous("Length", breaks = breaks) + 
  scale_y_continuous("Cumulative Per", breaks = seq(0, 100, 10))
```

# Percentile Ranks and Percentiles
- Percentile Ranks:
    - The percentage of scores at or below a given point.
    - Denoted by $P_{R}(X)$, read as the percentile rank of score $X$.
- Percentiles:
    - The point on the score scale below which a specified percentage of scores fall.
    - Denoted by $P_{%}%
- A percentile is the inverse of a percentile rank.
- The percentile rank of a given point on the score scale is the percentage of scores falling below this point in the ordered series of scores.
    - The value of the point iteself is the percentile corresponding to this percentile rank.
    - Example: if $P_{R}(X) = 60$, then $P_{60} = X$.
- Never say, 'My score was **in** the top quartile'.
    - A quartile (or percentile or decile) is a point on the score scale, not an interval.
    - Instead say, 'My score was at the top quartile'.
    
# Special Percentile Points
- Deciles:
    - $D_{1} = P_{10}$ - First decile
    - $D_{2} = P_{20}$ - Second decile
    - $D_{5} = Q_{2} = P_{50} = Mdn$ - Median
    - $Q_{1} = P_{25}$ - First Quartile
    - $Q_{3} = P_{75}$ - Third Quartile
    
# Estimate Percentile Ranks/Percentiles
```{r ogivepercent2}
cf <- ggplot(length_df, aes(x = brks, y = I(cf/max(cf)*100))) + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
cf + geom_point() + geom_line() + 
  scale_x_continuous("Length", breaks = breaks) + 
  scale_y_continuous("Cumulative Per", breaks = seq(0, 100, 10))
```

- $P_{R}(122) = $
- $P_{R}(160) = $
- $P_{50} = $
- $P_{80} = $

# Decile Differences
![Normal Distribution](Decile_Normal.png)
![Skewed Distribution](Decile_Skew.png)
![Bimodal Distribution](Decile_Bimodal.png)

# Quartiles and Shape
- Symmetrical: 
    - $Q_{3} - Q_{2} = Q_{2} - Q_{1}$
- Positive Skew:
    - $Q_{3} - Q_{2} > Q_{2} - Q_{1}$
- Negative Skew:
    - $Q_{3} - Q_{1} < Q_{2} - Q_{1}$
    

# Ogive Shape
![Ogive Shape](Ogive_Shape.png)


# Bar Graphs
- Bar graphs are a way to visually show a frequency table for qualitative variables.
- Can also be used to show other variables on the y-axis for qualitative variables.
- Has gaps to show the differences in groups.
- Order should be meaningful, either alphabetical for nominal variables or in the correct order for ordinal variables.

```{r bar}
b <- ggplot(filter(movies, mpaa != ''), aes(x = mpaa)) + theme_bw(base_size = 16)
b + geom_bar()
```

# Pie Charts
- Pie charts are useful to show the percentage of the whole for each group.
- The sum of the pieces of the pie must add up to 100% for this chart to be meaningful.

```{r pie}
pie_tab <- table(filter(movies, mpaa != '')$mpaa)[2:5]
lbls <- paste(names(pie_tab), "\n", pie_tab, sep = "")
pie(pie_tab, labels = lbls)
```

# Poor graphics
- Care needs to be made when constructing good graphics.
- It is easy for graphs to mislead/mask the purpose. 
- The goal should be to easily convey the message.
